# Stack-implementation-using-SLL
Stack data structure is implemented using singly linked list in c programming language

pre- requisite: singly linked list, stack implementation using arrays

Stack implemented using array makes the stack static hence the size of the stack is fixed before hand.
Dynamicaaly allocating memory to the stack during run time solves the problem of knowing the size of the stack before hand.
Hence implementing stack using data structures like singly linked list solves the problem of static memory allocation.
